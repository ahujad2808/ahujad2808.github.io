# ONGC Full stack Project

In today's data-driven world, leveraging advanced technologies to enhance operational
efficiency and profitability is crucial for any organization. This report details the
development and implementation of a comprehensive full-stack web application for the
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). The primary objective of this project is to boost
ONGC's profitability through the integration of sophisticated prediction models,
employing both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques.
The web application serves as a robust platform that not only provides seamless user
interactions but also incorporates predictive analytics to offer actionable insights. By
applying multiple prediction models, we aim to forecast key performance indicators,
optimize resource allocation, and anticipate market trends, thereby enabling ONGC to
make informed, data-driven decisions.
In addition to the predictive functionalities, the application features a suite of interactive
visualizations, presenting complex data through intuitive graphs and charts. These visual
tools are designed to enhance the user's understanding of the underlying data patterns
and trends, facilitating more effective decision-making processes.
This report will cover the following key aspects of the project:
1. Problem Definition: An overview of the full-stack web application, detailing the
front-end and back-end components, and their interactions.
2. Prediction Models: A comprehensive analysis of the various ML and DL models
implemented, including their design, training, and evaluation.
3. Data Visualization: Description of the graphical representations used to
visualize the data and model predictions.
4. Results and Insights: A summary of the findings from the predictive models
and the potential impact on ONGC's profitability.
5. Future Work: Recommendations for further enhancements and potential areas
for future research and development.
This project demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating predictive analytics
within an organizational framework, showcasing how advanced technologies can drive
significant improvements in performance and profitability.
